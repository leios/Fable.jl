# The fid (Function ID) is used to select which operation in a

# The fid could have multiple function systems in it. Quick example:
#     2 function systems (fs) with 3 and 5 functions respectively.
#     The fid might be 011 01, read from right to left
#     The first 2 digits, 01, represent a selection between 1 and 3 from fs 1
#     The second 3 digits, 011, represent a selection between 1 and 5 from fs 2
